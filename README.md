# Crypto Website Frontend

\*\* This document is a work in progress

## About This Project

The cryptocurrency website is meant to be a pseudo-clone of the Coin Market Cap website. It should include as
many core features as possible including, but not limited to: current cryptocurrency and exchange data, as well
as the ability for users to log in and manage portfolios. A user should be able to move seamlessly from
browsing various cryptocurrencies, to reading metadata, to being able to create their own favorites list as
well. The website itself is built on ReactJS and is designed to be data driven.

This is a full stack application. The backend server repo can be found [here](https://github.com/ChristopherH-eth/Nodejs-crypto-website-backend), and it uses a MongoDB
NoSQL cloud database.
